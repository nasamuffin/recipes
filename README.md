# Recipes That Nasa Your Muffin

I write and design software for work, but at home, I like to cook. A lot.

This repo is intended to contain recipes I either wrote on my own, or modified
enough that they are now distinct from the original.

I use American units (degrees Farenheit, cups, teaspoons, tablespoons) except
for weight, where I tend to prefer grams.

## Cookbook Recommendations

I also cook from cookbooks quite often. When I use them, I annotate the margins
heavily with the approximate date and any modifications I made, and how I think
they went. Here's a few I love and rely on:

### _Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat_ by Samin Nosrat

Less of a cookbook and more of a how-to-cook book. She's got great lookup
tables for developing recipes in all kinds of flavor profiles, and tips for how
to cook them authentically and deliciously. Also, she's a massive dork, so the
book is full of cute graphics and jokes.

### _King Arthur Baker's Companion_

Great starting point with lots of favorites. I use and modify recipes from here
all the time.

### _Maangchi's Big Book of Korean Cooking_

Slowly but slowly cooking my way through this one. It's great for everything
from the basics to the more complex multi-day recipes. She does a good job
explaining the whys and hows, and the results are delicious!

### _The Bread Baker's Apprentice_ by Peter Reinhart

A really great read for the fundamentals of breadbaking. How to understand
recipes and what the dough should look like, how to age them, how to knead,
how to bake, everything. Mostly baking lessons, with a few recipes towards the
end, the first half is the really valuable bit, but I've made a few of the
recipes as well.

## Index

(Hopefully I keep this up-to-date okay...)

### Breakfast

* [Grab and Go Overnight Oats](breakfast/overnight-oats.md)

### Lazy Meals

Sometimes you want to spend all day cooking, and sometimes you want minimum
effort to get something out either faster or with less effort than it takes to
work through DoorDash. These are the latter.

* [Oven-Roasted Tomato Sauce](lazy-meals/roasted-tomato-sauce.md)
* [Pasta Bake](lazy-meals/pasta-bake.md)

And... these are the former. Good for an occasion, to impress someone, or to
