# Oven-Roasted Tomato Pasta Sauce

This recipe's awesome because the most labor-intensive part of it is peeling
the garlic. You can make it with an immersion blender or a large regular
pitcher blender, but if you're using a regular blender, be really careful with
the hot roasted veggies and juice. The second hardest part is sitting in your
house while it gradually smells more and more like roasted garlic and not
drowning in your own drool.

Have your roasting pan in mind when you buy tomatoes. Too many and you won't
get that nice Maillard browning on the skins; too few and they'll dry out more
than you want to blend into a little sauce. I usually use a high-walled quarter
sheet pan (like a brownie pan), high-walled oven-safe skillet, or enameled
cast-iron Dutch oven or braiser.

## Ingredients

* Tomatoes, enough to fill the floor of your pan in a single layer. (Romas
  work best, because they've got more surface area to brown, but heirlooms are
  hard to resist, so sometimes I buy and use those, instead.)
* 1 yellow or white onion, cut into eighths
* (optional) Other roast-friendly veggies, like carrots, eggplants, or
  mushrooms
* Garlic to taste (my taste is half a head), peeled but whole
* Olive oil
* Salt
* (optional) ground or chopped meat or sausage, about 1lb

## Procedure

1. Preheat oven to 425F or so.
1. De-sticker, wash, and de-stem your tomatoes, but leave them whole.
1. If using other veggies, cut them appropriately for roasting - halve
   mushrooms or leave them whole, cut eggplants or carrots into 2" pieces,
   whatever seems appropriate. Remember that you want maximum Maillard reaction
   and minimum moisture loss.
1. Add the tomatoes, onions, garlic, and other veggies (if using) to the
   roasting pan. Try to keep them in a single layer.
1. Drizzle olive oil over the top, trying to get as much coverage as possible
   without obsessing. The oil helps the veggies brown up, and it'll go into
   your sauce and make it taste rounder, so don't be shy.
1. Salt liberally over the top. Remember you're salting enough for the entire
   batch of sauce. Doing the salt after you do the oil helps the salt stick
   down to the veggies and stay in place.
1. Roast for 45-60 minutes, until the tomato skin is cracked and starting
   towards brown, or until you can't stand the delicious smell anymore. The
   onions and garlic also ought to look pleasantly browning and crispy. Take
   it out of the oven.
1. If you're adding ground meat, leave the oven on; otherwise you can shut it
   off now.
1. If you're having it with pasta and not adding ground meat, now's a good
   time to start the pasta.
1. You'll have a roasting pan full of liquid and hot, soft tomatoes. If you're
   using an immersion blender, move the pan to a hot pad and go after it with
   the blender til it's smooth (or as smooth as you want to toss with pasta).
   If you're using a regular blender, carefully ladle the roasted veggies into
   the blender pitcher, then ladle or pour the liquid from the bottom of the
   pan into the blender as well. Run it til it's the amount of chunky/smooth
   you think will be good with your pasta shape.
1. Optional: If you want to add ground meat, add it to your roasting pan and
   break it up now. Pour the sauce on top, cover the pan, and put it back into
   the oven for another half hour or so.
1. Serve the blended (or blended and re-braised) sauce with your favorite
   pasta. Since it's pretty smooth, I like it with fusilli or penne.
