# Pasta Bake

This recipe is a canvas. It can be cheesy. It can be spicy. It can be meaty.
You build it pretty much like you build nachos or lasagna, and it is about
as much effort as you feel like putting forth.

## Ingredients

* 2 6oz cans of tomato paste
* Olive oil
* Water
* 1 lb of dry pasta (you can use fresh pasta if you're making some anyway, but
  careful that it doesn't stick together in the casserole). Choose a bite-sized
  shape like penne, rotini, or shells, rather than a long shape like spaghetti.
* Minced garlic, to taste (my taste is about half a head)
* Shredded cheese to top
* Salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste

From here, the add-in choices are endless. Some possibilities:

* Cheese: shredded cheese, the end of that container of cream cheese,
  mozzarella pearls
* Meat: ground meat or ground sausage works best; sliced sausage links work
  well too; Impossible/Beyond imitation meat works great.
* Leafy veggies: frozen and thawed/squeezed spinach, chopped fresh kale, the
  rest of that clamshell of basil, arugula
* Meaty veggies: mushrooms of any kind, the summer gourds like eggplant and
  zucchini, the root veggies like carrots, onions
* Fridge clearing: Leftover cooked chicken breast, half an onion, the last bit
  of that red wine you didn't love, the herbs starting to wilt
* Flavor boosties: bullion paste or cubes, garlic or ginger paste, MSG

## Procedure

1. Preheat the oven to around 375F.
1. Make the sauce base first. Open up both cans of tomato paste and put them
   in a big mixing bowl (I use an 8-cup Pyrex); add a healthy pour of water,
   healthy splash of olive oil, and healthy pinch of salt. Mix it up - it
   should be about the same consistency as jarred pasta or pizza sauce, if not
   a little thinner. You want a lot of water in it to cook the pasta in the
   oven. Add more water as needed until it's the right consistency.
1. Add the garlic, and other veggies, to the sauce. You can decide how finicky
   you want to be about your add-ins; if you want to place them exactly so,
   leave them out of the sauce, but if you just roughly want them throughout
   the casserole, it's easy to mix them in with the sauce. You can do this with
   the ground meat or sausage if you want, just remember food safety and don't
   leave your raw meat sauce in the fridge for a long time.
1. Add a little bit of the sauce to the bottom of your casserole (I use a 7x11"
   most of the time, but sometimes I use a bigger one; trust your instincts.)
1. Add the first layer of dry pasta. Try not to overdo it, it should be about
   half your container of pasta.
1. Add more sauce to cover; if you're carefully arranging some of the mix-ins,
   do it now.
1. Keep alternating dry pasta and sauce until you're out of both. The last
   layer should be a sauce layer; if you don't have enough sauce to cover the
   dry pasta, you can just pour some water or broth right in on top.
1. Cover the entire top liberally in shredded cheese - that's what makes it
   melty and good!
1. Bake for 45-60 minutes, until the top is browned and bubbling. It's a good
   idea to put a pan on the next rack under your casserole to catch drips,
   this bubbles pretty fiercely.
1. Slice and enjoy!
