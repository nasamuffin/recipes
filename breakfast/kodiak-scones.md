# Protein Scones with Kodiak Pancake Mix

Consider this one a work in progress, but I liked the first try so much that I'm
comfortable writing it up here.

This recipe is modified from the [Kodiak website](https://kodiakcakes.com/blogs/recipes/blueberry-scone).
I converted the ingredients to weight using the lookup table in the front of
the [King Arthur All-Purpose Baker's Companion](../README.md#cookbook-recommendations).
I also subbed out sour cream instead of heavy cream; it lasts longer in the fridge
and has more flavor, and I don't love the whole-grain-y flavor that Kodiak mix
can tend to have, so I think it's worth subbing.

## Ingredients

* 500g Kodiak Power Cakes flapjack & waffle mix
* 50g (1/4 C) sugar
* 170g (12 Tbsp, 1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold
* 2 eggs
* 227g (1 C) sour cream
* 1/2 C mix-ins
* Optional: a little milk or cream, for brushing tops

## Procedure

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. (I have been hearth baking a lot lately, so if
   you're using a baking stone, leave lots of time for it to warm up.)
1. Prepare a baking sheet. You could flour or grease one if you love messes,
   or you could be cool and put down a piece of parchment paper. I hearth baked
   mine, so I put a half-sheet of parchment paper on a single-edged cookie sheet
   which I could use as a peel to deposit the goods right onto the baking stone.
1. Mix the dry ingredients.
1. Cut in the butter. I used my bench knife to cut it into 1/2" cubes and then a
   pastry blender to cut it to pea-sized. It was a pretty good workout, but next
   time I'll probably just use my mixer.
1. Mix the wet ingredients together, then add to the dry ingredients and mix. It
   might not fully come together with just a mixing spoon or mixer paddle, but
   if you grab a handful and squeeze, it should stay together well enough. Do
   not turn it into a dough ball at this time!
1. Add the mix-ins and get them nice and distributed. I used dried sour cherries
   but I could also see nuts or chocolate chips or fresh berries or whatever
   the hell you want.
1. NOW you can bunch it up into a ball. You might need to get in there with
   your hand, but it should come together. It should be stiff but tacky.
1. Lightly, lightly flour a work surface. Think minimum effective dose. It's a
   stiff dough so you don't need a lot.
1. Checking for sticking, and adding flour if needed (but you probably won't
   need), pat the dough into a circle. You want it to be about 1" thick. Use the
   side of your hand or your bench scraper and tighten up the edges, or risk a
   crumbly edge on your finished scones!
1. Using your bench scraper, divide the circle into eight wedges. Wiggle them
   apart, then place them with around 2" of space between them on your prepared
   baking sheet.
1. Optionally, brush the tops with a little bit of milk or cream.
1. Bake for around 18-20 minutes. The Kodiak recipe says 12-15; I needed nearly
   20 in my oven, and my thermometer said I was a bit north of 400F in there, so
   I think the recipe might be bullshitting.

## Notes

The first time I made these (that is, at time of writing), #IDidntHaveEggs. So
I used 2Tbsp of chia seeds mixed with 2/3C of water, and let to sit for 15
minutes. It worked great, and I like that chia seeds have extra calcium, but I
think the flavor would be richer using actual eggs.

Scones, muffins, and basic cookies are great because you can put whatever mix-in
you want. When I did these, I used 1/2 C (ish) of dried sour cherries and added
a from-the-heart-but-probably-1Tbsp dose of vanilla extract in with the wets.
Very tasty.

They're filling! But light and fluffy. I was very hungry and still good for only
1.5 scones.

When I made this, the scones came out HUGE. Like 5-6" radius. It might be a
little less unwieldy for your breakfast guests to split the dough in half, then
form two rounds and make mini scones instead, because they're so filling. If you
do, remember to watch them closely in the oven, because they probably need less
time to bake.
