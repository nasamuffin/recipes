# Fluffy Scrambled Eggs

This has probably proliferated everywhere, but I still see chefs putting
forward a scrambled egg method I feel is pretty meh. So here's mine. It works
best in a very nonstick pan with no oil, but you can make it with oil in a less
nonsticky pan if you want. The key is the splash of water, which steams the
eggs from inside, making them lofty and fluffy instead of wrung-out and sad.

Tip: The easiest way to get scrambled egg detritus out of any pan, including
a cast iron, is to toss a cup of water into the still-hot pan and let the water
boil while pushing a spatula around. The egg flakes come right up, and you can
dump the whole mess into the sink (if you've got a garbage disposal, or through
a strainer if you don't), let the pan cool, and finish up with your regular
implements of destruction.

## Ingredients

* 1-2 eggs per person (ask how many they want!)
* Sea salt and black pepper to taste
* Water

## Procedure

1. Heat the pan somewhere between medium and medium-high.
1. Whisk the eggs in a container that won't make a mess when you pour it.
   Beat them well, but don't fuss so much about introducing a lot of air or
   getting it completely perfect.
1. Add salt - probably a liberal pinch per person.  You can't really taste it
   yet just now, so don't overdo it.
1. Put a splash of water into the eggs - probably a little less than a
   tablespoon per person, but honestly, I usually eyeball it straight from the
   tap. Give them another good stir to make sure the water and salt are
   evenly distributed in with the eggs.
1. If you're using a not-nonstick pan, add a little oil (maybe 2Tbsp) and let
   it heat up. Swirl the pan around so the oil coats the entire bottom of the
   pan.
1. Pour the eggs into the pan.
1. Use a rubber spatula. Alternate giving a stir back and forth (moving around
   curds, once they start forming) and waiting a second or two. It won't take
   long, but you want to be standing over it actively moving the curds around.
   Using the rubber spatula means you can let your eggs form into big fluffy
   curds, and you get those by being conservative with your stirring, so don't
   overdo it - if you're whisking constantly or stirring too vigorously,
   you'll get a mealy mess.
1. They're done when they're as dry-looking as you tend to like your eggs; some
   like them wet, I like mine dry but not browning.
1. I like mine on toast with a little sprinkle of salt and a scrape of ketchup.
