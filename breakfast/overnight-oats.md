# Grab and Go Overnight Oats

I don't crave oatmeal very often, but my partner is nuts for oats. We both find
overnight oats made with rolled oats to be too sludgy and soft, so I like to
make mine with steel cut oats - these are the ones that look like coarse
granules, not the flat oatey-shaped oat you may be familiar with from instant
oatmeal.

I also like to be able to just uncork these in the morning and go, without a
bunch of fuss about add-ons. So I make them with the fruit, sweetener, and so
on already inside overnight. If you find them too tough the next morning, they
are great on the second morning; much longer than that and they start to go
off, though.

If you don't have a restriction, really don't skip the nut butter, because when
it firms up in the fridge overnight, it takes on a pudding-like texture that
makes every bite a treat.

There's no ingredient quantities listed, because this really has to do with the
container you're filling. I use my 200mL Weck jars, which are suitable for one
serving each, and I make 2-6 at a time.

When you make these, keep an eye to aesthetics; nothing cheers up your morning
like a beautiful, clean, healthy breakfast. Coordinate the choice of nut
butter, fruit, and sweetener to make a cohesive tasty combination.

## Ingredients

* Nut or seed butter of your choice (tahini, NuttZo, flavored nut butters, or
  even just your favorite peanut butter work great)
* Steel cut oats
* Sweetener (optional) - maple syrup, honey, rice syrup, brown sugar, whatever
  you like
* Fresh fruit, cut into bite-sized pieces if necessary - peach, strawberries,
  blueberries, blackberries, whatever you have and crave.
* Milk or milk alternative (I love Straus's cream-top whole milk)

## Procedure

1. Spread your containers out in your workspace. You want them to all be about
   even, so you're going to fill each layer in all of them before moving on
   to the next.
1. Start with the nut butter. Spoon a tablespoon or so into the bottom of each
   container and spread it around so you have a flat layer, maybe 1/8 to 1/4
   inch thick.
1. Next, pour oats into each container, leaving 3/4" or so of headroom. Give
   the containers a shake to get a flat, even surface of oats.
1. Drizzle or sprinkle just a little bit of sweetener, if you're using it. I
   use a couple teaspoons, but really, I just eyeball it. If you have a sweet
   tooth, use more. If you're using a very sweet fruit or sweetened/flavored
   nut butter, use less, or skip completely.
1. Put the fruit on top of the sweetener - the fruit doesn't need more sugar
   but the oats do. Arrange them in a way that pleases you - this will be the
   first thing you see in the morning, so it should look yummy. I like to do
   my strawberries cut-side-up, with blueberries scattered in between, or
   blackberries and raspberries mixed together. You might like making them in
   sections - strawberries in one third, bananas in another third, peaches in
   the last. Follow your heart, and leave only enough space to get the lid on.
   (Do not put the lid on yet.)
1. Finally, pour your milk over the whole deal, all the way up to the top. When
   you get to the last container, go back and take a second pass, as the milk
   will soak into the dry oats a little bit. (Or, if you're just making one
   container, wait 30 seconds and top it off again.)
1. Put the lid on and stick them in the fridge. On the first morning, they'll
   still be pretty chewy; on the second morning and later, they'll be softer.
   They probably won't last more than five days, especially if you used cut
   fruit, so don't forget about them for too long.
