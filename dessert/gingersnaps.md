# Extra-Spicy Gingersnaps

Adapted from _The Joy of Cooking_.

Ok, this is pretty much the Joy gingersnap recipe, but with literally double
the spices, plus a bit of cayenne to really warm the whole cookie up. In my
opinion, when you eat a gingersnap, it should be a GINGERsnap. So these fit the
bill. You may want to taste the batter (just a little) to make sure it's not
too spicy for you (or too bland...).

I make these in my KitchenAid stand mixer with an aftermarket rubber spatula
paddle attachment, and use the rubber spatula for creaming as well as mixing
in the dry ingredients. If you aren't doing this, after the wet ingredients are
all together, swap out the whisk for the flat beater attachment.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cups of butter (1.5 sticks), room temperature
* 2 cups white sugar (or cane sugar)
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1/2 cup blackstrap molasses
* 2 teaspoons white vinegar
* 3 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1.5 teaspoons baking soda
* 2 tablespoons ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (I use spicy Vietnamese cinnamon)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
* 3 pinches salt

## Procedure

1. Preheat the oven to 325F.
1. Prepare baking sheets by covering them in parchment paper or a silicone
   baking mat. You can use rimmed cookie sheets or not rimmed; whatever you've
   got. This makes a really big batch, so the paper helps you keep batches
   cycling in and out of the oven.
1. Cream together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer.
1. Add the eggs, molasses, and vinegar and beat until combined.
1. In another bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: the flour, baking soda,
   ginger, cinnamon, cloves, cayenne, and salt. Sifting or whisking them
   together makes your cookies more consistent and even throughout.
1. Slowly add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients with your mixer on low.
1. Once all the flour is added, you can turn up the speed to make sure the
   dough is thoroughly combined.
1. Drop onto the prepared baking sheets in 3/4" balls.
1. Bake each tray for about 12 minutes, They're done when they're starting to
   brown at the edges.
1. Try not to inhale every warm cookie as it comes out. Good luck.
