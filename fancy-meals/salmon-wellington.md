# Salmon Wellington

An all-time favorite of mine. It takes time, but not all that much effort. You
can get creative with how you fold, cut, or braid the puff pastry around your
fish and impress the heck out of your dinner guests. (I've successfully used
this when meeting my ex's parents over Thanksgiving the first time.)

I have never made it with homemade puff pastry. (I'd like to, sometime!) I buy
the frozen Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets; be careful, because they're
usually sitting right next to the little round puff pastry circles for making
fancy desserts or hors d'ouvres, and if you get home with your big cut of
salmon and a box of dainty little pastry circles, you will be disappointed.
This recipe uses one sheet; the box usually comes with two sheets. You can
stick the second one back in the freezer, just use it before it gets
freezerburned.

The general concept here is that the moisture from the sauteed onion mixture
will steam the fish, keeping it from drying out. This can result in a rubbery
skin, so I usually take the skin off the filet. (You can save the skin and
roast or fry it separately for a tasty crunchy snack!) You can also swap up the
ingredients in the onion mix, but remember that it should be pretty moist for
the steam to work.

## Ingredients

### Onion mix
* 1 onion (any kind; take your preference), sliced
* 1 leek, halved, sliced, and washed
* Neutral oil for sauteeing
* Salt, pepper, herbs, seasonings to taste

### Wellington
* 1 sheet of puff pastry, thawed
* Flour for dusting
* 1 large filet of salmon, skin removed (see preface)
* 1 egg white
* Salt, pepper, seasonings to taste

## Procedure

### Onion mix

Make the onion mix about an hour before you want to put the wellington into the
oven - warm onion mix will melt your puff pastry and make it hard to get into
shape.

1. Sautee the leek and onion bits in oil over medium-high heat until just
   translucent. Add salt and seasonings to taste (and do taste it, often!)
1. Set aside and let it cool.

### Wellington

Really, seriously, make sure the onion mixture is cool. You might need to walk
away for half an hour.

1. Preheat the oven to 375F.
1. Prepare a rimmed baking sheet by covering it with parchment paper or a
   silicone baking mat. Or, if you love cleaning off crusty bits, you can just
   oil and flour the bottom of the sheet so that your wellington doesn't stick.
1. Liberally dust a surface and your rolling pin with flour.
1. Lay out the puff pastry sheet, and dust the surface of that with flour, too.
1. Roll the pastry out until it's 3 times the width of the short width of your
   salmon, and 3-4" longer than the long width on either side. Frequently move
   and flip the pastry sheet around on your work surface, adding more flour as
   needed, so you can make sure it's not sticking down.
1. Move the pastry to the top of your prepared sheet pan, approximately
   centered.
1. Add the cooled(!!) onion mixture to the middle of the puff pastry. Push it
   around until you have a bed of onions that is approximately the shape and
   size of your salmon filet.
1. Add your salmon filet on top of the onions.
1. Fold the short sides over the ends of your filet first.
1. Next, you can use kitchen shears to decoratively cut the side flaps of
   pastry. If you cut both sides like a take-a-number tear-off strip, you can
   make them look like a little braid as you fold them over the fish and over
   each other; if you only cut one side that way, you can fold the whole side
   first, then fold the strips over the top, and it makes a neat striped look.
   Go wild with it - just remember that you don't want the top to be totally
   wide open, because you need the fish to steam a little bit inside.
1. Put your egg white in a little glass or cup and add a tiny splash of water.
   Whisk this well, then apply it with a pastry brush all over the outside of
   your folded-up wellington.
1. Bake until the outside of the wellington is an appetizing golden brown,
   usually like 40 minutes. With fish, you don't have to worry too much about
   it being undercooked inside - 40 minutes in the oven is enough to finish
   pretty much any fish to safety.
1. When it's finished, use a spatula (or two) to carefully transfer the
   wellington to a serving platter or cutting board. You should be able to get
   through it with a metal spatula to serve, since the fish will be flaky and
   soft. Remember that the "heels" have twice as much breading on them, and
   serve the chef accordingly.

## Tips

* Leeks get dirt all up in their leaves - you can't really clean them before
  cutting them. First, trim off the root and the dried out cut ends. Lay the
  leek flat (it only fans out one way, so it should naturally lie) and cut it
  in half, lengthwise, down the center. Then chop it into 1/4"-1/2" slices.
  Put all the chopped leek into a bowl, then fill it with water and swish the
  leek around real good. Drain them, either with a strainer or just using a
  hand or spoon to hold the leek parts in while the water parts drain out.
* This meal microwaves like a champ. Don't be afraid, it's almost better from
  the microwave than it was fresh. Almost.
